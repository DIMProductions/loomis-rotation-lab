# 🎛️ Loomis Rotation Lab v0.1 // TRACE PRACTICE RIG

A lightweight **browser-based Loomis head rotation practice tool**.
Right now it’s not a “smart teacher” — it’s a **trace-mode lab** with stripe guides so you can grind rotations fast.

**No install. No accounts. Just open the demo and practice.**

* **Trace Mode**: Loomis head + stripe guides for rotation practice
* **Canvas UI**: Fast, clean, minimal friction
* **Rig Separation**: Math/rig logic separated from UI for future expansion

## 🔧 Features (Current)

* **Trace Practice**: Overlay stripe guides and Loomis construction lines
* **Rotation Practice Grid**: Use it like a worksheet generator / drill board
* **Dark UI**: Doesn’t burn your eyes while you repeat reps
* **Static Hosting Friendly**: Pure front-end

---

## 🔍 What it is NOT (Yet)

* **No Audit PASS/FAIL** right now
* No automatic “fix your head” coaching
* No export pipeline (PDF/PNG) *yet*

Stop expecting magic — this is a practice rig first.
